JavaScript Carousel
This project implements a simple, responsive image carousel using vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to navigate through a series of images with left and right buttons, and it adjusts dynamically when the browser window is resized.

Features
Responsive: The carousel automatically adjusts when the browser is resized.
Navigation: Users can navigate left and right through the images.
Wrap-around: The carousel wraps around when navigating beyond the first or last image.
Cleanup: Event listeners can be removed when no longer needed.
